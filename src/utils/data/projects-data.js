      "Developing Archeo has been a rewarding experience, leveraging technologies like React, SCSS, OpenLayers, and Three.js to create a comprehensive archaeological data management system. I focused on building a user-friendly interface that simplifies cataloging and searching, while ensuring compliance with ICCD regulations. A key feature was the integration of Web GIS using OpenLayers, allowing users to visualize geo-spatial data effectively on a map. Additionally, I utilized Three.js to showcase 3D models of archaeological finds, enhancing user engagement and understanding. A robust user roles management system was implemented to control data access and modifications, preserving data integrity. Overall, the development of Archeo has not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the unique needs in the archaeological field.",

      "Me and my team built an AI-powered Patent generation system. My role was to build user-friendly, intuitive and functional front-end collaborating with designer and fellow developers. I built the front end to facilitate easy navigation through complex patent generation processes, ensuring users can seamlessly access features like multilingual support and AI-driven generation. By implementing RESTful API integration and WebSocket, I enabled real-time updates and interactions, allowing users to receive immediate feedback and streamline their workflows. I utilized Shadow DOM to encapsulate component styles, enhancing performance and maintainability. Features such as find and replace, custom toolbar for styling, and a chatbot powered by the OpenAI API were also developed to assist users in navigating the platform effectively. Overall, my contributions were pivotal in creating a sophisticated, interactive platform that harnesses the power of AI to streamline the patent generation process.",

      "I played a key role in developing the SIVA vehicle inspection system, which includes a mobile app built with React Native and an admin website using Vue and Laravel. My contributions focused on facilitating efficient vehicle inspection scheduling and management. In the mobile app, I implemented features that allow users to easily schedule inspections, upload screenshots or videos of their vehicles, and communicate in real-time with inspectors through integrated Socket.io. This significantly enhances user engagement and streamlines the inspection process. I ensured that inspectors have the necessary tools to effectively review uploaded media and assess vehicle conditions. Additionally, I developed the admin dashboard, providing inspectors with robust functionalities to manage inspections and respond to user inquiries. I utilized RESTful APIs to ensure seamless data synchronization between the mobile app and the admin site. By leveraging modern technologies, I addressed challenges related to cross-platform compatibility and created a user-friendly experience throughout the system.",
